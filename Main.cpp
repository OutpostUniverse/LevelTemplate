//		 in it. However, most other trigger callback functions
//		 won't have a function prototype anywhere (and you really

//		 should never be calling a callback function yourself)
//		 so you should use the SCRIPT_API macro when you define
//		 the function.
//		 Might as well set a good example. =)
